Welcome to the Keyboard Autocompleter

This application is used to capture keyboard input and offer suggestions on how a word is likely to be completed.

In order to run it, download the Keyboard_Autocompleter.jar file.
Make sure that you have an updated version of JRE (Java Runtime Environment) on your machine.
Open a command prompt or terminal and change the directory to the jar file you downloaded.

Enter this into the command line and press enter: java -jar Keyboard_Autocompleter.jar

Thank you for using my application :D
