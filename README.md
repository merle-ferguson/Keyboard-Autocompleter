# **Welcome to the Keyboard Autocompleter**

This application is used to capture keyboard input and offer suggestions on how a word is likely to be completed.

## To build it:

I used Eclipse, but you could easily use the command line or terminal by following the instructions below.

Make sure that you have an updated version of JDK (Java Development Kit) on your machine.

Open your command line/terminal and navigate to my project's src directory, which contains the java files and manifest file.

If you are running windows, type PATH=C:\Program Files\Java\[jdk version]\bin

Fill in [jdk version] with your Java Development Kit version.

Type javac *.java

Type jar cvfm Keyboard_Autocompleter.jar manifest.txt *.class

## To run it:

Enter this into the command line and press enter: java -jar Keyboard_Autocompleter.jar

From there, you will have instructions on how to use it.
Please note, -T must be prepended to any training input.

For example:
-T The third thing that I need to tell you is that this thing does not think thoroughly.

Thank you for using my application :D
